This application is built to support the Burnett institute and their mission to eradicate HIV, primarily through increased testing. The primary aims of the site are to provide a safe and welcoming environment for potential sufferers of HIV by providing the following supportive options; guidance on where to purchase self testing kits, an avenue to submit the results of the self testing kits and then receive (generic and customized) advice and recommendations for treatment and general advice on HIV and the testing process (by way of info dumps and managed chat bot).

The Burnett Institute will review and provide the appropriate advice, manage users, review analytics on single and population scale and work together with partner organisation to ensure that the populace utilising the site is supported.
